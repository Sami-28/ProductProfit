# ProductProfit
We analyze data to find the profit activity of products and take different measures to dimensions 

# Objective/Purpose 
Our objective is to analyze the products' activity. I decided to group the many items into their subcategories to measure them against their specific states. What kinds of subcategories are having the most profit? Copiers, Phones, and Accessories to name a few. Which states are bringing the most profit for the superstore? California, New York, and Washington. We can also use tableau to find out the amount of each state during each month. Which specific products are causing the greatest number of returns? Which have the greatest profit and loss? We take a look into the data to find the results.
